RCM means Responsive Class Manager

Responsive Class Manager

Do you ever worked with Boostrap Framework 3?
do you recognize: hidden-xs, hidden-sm, etc. ?
do you ever wanted to do something like: add-class-xs-balloon (when xs breakpoint then add this class)

Well, then, this is the solution :)

And was made with less-than-three by me
